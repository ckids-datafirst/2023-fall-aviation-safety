&lt;p>The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Aviation safety reporting system. The original ASRS dataset has more than 300 thousand rows of information from the year 1988. Since we are specifically interested in runway incursion we applied a filter while downloading the dataset and received a subset of 46,000 rows and 126 columns. The rudimentary goal is to analyse this dataset to identify fracture points in safety regulations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-overview-and-examples">Data Overview and Examples&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The ASRS data is anonymised reports collected from individuals working in the aviation sector. The dataset contains the credentials of the reporting person (excluding personally identifiable content), time and date of the incident, name of the airport, state, altitude, visibility, narrative etc. We intend to use a subset of the 127 features already present with us. The reason is that there are multiple features with a negligible amount of data making analysis unfavourable. Therefore we intend to drop those features completely before further processing. ASRS is the largest data repository available for aviation safety incidents therefore any other dataset which is publicly available may either be a subset of ASRS or might not be reliable since ASRS is a government-backed dataset.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-accessibility">Data Accessibility&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The dataset is accessible through a web portal. There are multiple filters that a user could use to extract the data based on time, type of incident, reporting agency etc. Since we are interested in runway incursions we used word filters like runway, ramp and taxiway. The major constraint for downloading the dataset is at a time only 10,000 rows can be downloaded. Therefore we had to download 5 reports and collate them together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-formats">Data Formats&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The dataset can be downloaded in Excel, CSV, pdf, word and HTML formats from the ASRS portal. For ease of use with Python, we preferred the usage of csv format.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-challenges">Data Challenges&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The most challenging part of the dataset is the narrative. The narrative is a description of the incident from a reporter/observer’s point of view. All the reports available in the dataset are not written in aviation English. For instance, airplane, aircraft and flight may essentially point towards the same object but are written in diverse ways. Similarly, the runway is often time written as rwy. All the reports are not written in a professional manner, for instance in a report pilot makes an attempt to humor by mentioning “spilling coffee in the cockpit”. This information is futile as far as the algorithm is concerned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="data-visualizations-and-highlights">Data Visualizations and Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Including a visualization is a simple way to show something interesting about the data. Perhaps the visualizations could simply highlight the size, distribution, and other simple statistical characteristics of the data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This page serves as a &lt;strong>Problem and Requirements Document&lt;/strong> for the project. It should be no more than 5 pages long. It should be done after or in combination with the Data Assessment document. It should have an initial release after no more than four weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the project is better understood.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The project advisor should have provided the general context for the project, the kinds of problems that could be addressed using the data available, and the overall motivation for working in this area.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="problem-for-the-semester">Problem for the Semester&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While the motivation section typically describes the long-term reasons to tackle this project, the problem section should focus on the specific problem and goals selected for the current semester. It should be a realistic goal that can be accomplished with the resources available, and this typically means the data, the people, the time available. It is useful to be specific about the initial questions that will be addressed first, because those typically lead to a better understanding of what other questions could be tackled. This will help establish a clear scope for the project that will give everyone reasonable confidence of what the team can achieve. It is also very useful to describe what the team is not going to tackle and has agreed to leave for future work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="state-of-the-art">State of the Art&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Provide a brief summary or survey of the possible approaches, advances, or tools that are currently available that could potentially be used to address the problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="design-and-approach">Design and Approach&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss the initial approach that the team will follow. This may include the key idea that the team believes could potentially work, and a high-level description of 1) the system to be built and a diagram of its components, 2) the inputs to the system and the task that it will do with that data, and 3) the outputs to be generated. Discuss also a baseline system that is simple and can be quickly built to address the problem in a reasonable way even if it has poor performance, so that you can clearly show improvements. Discuss also how those improvements will be demonstrated through metrics or other means.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use-case-scenario">Use Case Scenario&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Show with a use case scenario with examples of who the ultimate users could be, what the system that you plan to build for the semester will do in that scenario. Provide a mockup of the outputs for the use case that you propose.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="desired-outcomes-and-benefits">Desired Outcomes and Benefits&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Connect back the system that you will be building with the initial motivation for the work, and what additional future work might be needed in order for the system to provide benefits to its users.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Results</title><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/template-project-website/results/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jun 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/template-project-website/results/</guid><description>&lt;p>This page contains key sections of the &lt;strong>Final Report&lt;/strong> for the project focused on results to date. It should be no more than 2 pages long. An initial draft can be created at any point during the project, and can be refined as the project progresses.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="system-and-model-performance">System and Model Performance&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Show the performance of the best system and model(s) developed, showing clearly the performance metrics and improvements over the baseline system as appropriate. Create visualizations that show clearly these results.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="discussion-of-findings">Discussion of Findings&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Offer a discussion of the main findings using the system developed. Put the results in the context of the original problem statement and the questions that were posed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Discuss any unexpected results, and potential explanations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Enumerate (ideally in bullets) the most important findings, and their impact on your project goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future Work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Discuss any limitations of the work to date, how these limitations could be addressed in future work. Discuss what lines of work are most promising given the understanding of the problem and the data gained throughout the project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/template-project-website/meetings/minutes_of_meeting_10_12_2023/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ckids-datafest.github.io/template-project-website/meetings/minutes_of_meeting_10_12_2023/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="points-discussed-in-the-meeting">Points discussed in the meeting:&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Upload data and other useful materials to the github repository for the professors to review&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Focus of Incursions - A classifier model for human errors like confusion, fatigue, etc can be designed which can then be tackled by the Federal Aviation Administration. Hint: To classify the data, we can check for keywords like fatigue, extra hours etc. which are related to &amp;ldquo;overtime&amp;rdquo; in the Narrative column of the ASRS dataset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Data Doubts:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;lsquo;Weather Element/Visibility&amp;rsquo; Numeric Value Meaning
Ans: The numeric value denotes visibility in miles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;lsquo;Ceiling&amp;rsquo; value meaning and usefulness? 0- completely fogged.
Ans: More the ceiling (height of the clouds), the better is the visibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;lsquo;Flight Phase&amp;rsquo; with multiple phases, eg: Parked; Landing; Landing, etc
Ans: They represent the different stages that the plane went through in during the incident. Some cells have redundant stages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;lsquo;Operating Under FAR Part&amp;rsquo; meaning?
Ans: The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) are rules prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governing all aviation activities in the United States.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Check out the power point presentation that was presented at an ASRS meeting and has 4 factors to identify the incursions. It was shared to us by Prof. Najmedin earlier in the emails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The team can get an award if everyone does a good job and wins the International Society of Air Safety Investigators (ISASI) conference. This year it will be held at Lisbon, Portugal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Update the project website with the current work done.&lt;/li>
