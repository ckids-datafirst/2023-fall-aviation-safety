        This [Fall 2023](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/#dates) [Application of AI, ML and NLP in understanding and preventing a serious aviation safety problem in the US - Runway Safety](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-aviation-safety/) addressed the problem of incursion related aviation safety incidents in the United States. It uses data about aircraft safety incidents sourced from Aviation Safety Reports System (data). Our work focuses on [Analyzing incursion reports and pointing system fracture points](approach). Our initial results indicate [1-sentence summary of results](results).

        This project builds on the work of a [previous DataFirst project](https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/projects/2023-spring/810/).

        Our data science project endeavors to apply AI, ML and NLP in understanding and prevent serious aviation safety problem in the US - Runway Safety]. Our motivation to address this problem stems from [a New York Times article which mentions series of Air Traffic Control lapses that nearly kills 131 people](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/11/business/air-traffic-control-austin-airport-fedex-southwest.html). This project has a potential to save thousands of lives if deployed in busiest airsapces across the world.
