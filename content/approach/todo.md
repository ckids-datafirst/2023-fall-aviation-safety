3. Contributing factors: Ravneet
4. Top 20 Airports by year: Shreyas
5. Top 15 concurrent anomalies: Likhit
6. Bar graphs on ASRS intake and runway incursion: Atharv
7. Runway incursion reported: Mino

## Interactive Dashbard that runs python scripts behind:
(Mino checks with Najm/Daniel if this is needed/makes sense for our project)
