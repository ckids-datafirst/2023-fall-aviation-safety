## Midterm Poster Feedback:
* Add student and faculty advisor names
* Just use ML in title
* Add date of new york times publication
* Add ‘NYT Article’ in the description of introduction
* Spell out ASRS once in the poster
* Replace ‘Runway Safety’ to ‘Runway Incursions’ to the title
* Double check - what can be called an ‘Incursion’ - may need to change graphs
* Use NTSB report as sample to make sure we do not classify something as runway incursion if it is not. Maybe try to match graphs and numbers from that presentation
* In conclusion add ‘Calibrated/matched model against NTSB report of 2017’

## Report:
* Add a couple of sample reports of ASRS for viewer understanding
* Document how and where we got the dataset
* We want to find the base level factors that are causing the incursions, for e.g., ‘human factor - sub categorize further and further’.
* We are only required to present an analysis to the concerned industry specialists
