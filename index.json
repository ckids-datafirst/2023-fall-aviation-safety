It should have an initial release after no more than eight weeks into the project, and can serve as an interim project report. It can be refined as the project progresses and the problem is better understood.\nData Quality The data initially sourced from ASRS contains more than 46,000 rows and 120 columns of data. Upon visual and statistical analysis it is realised that the data contains multiple duplicate columns and many columns contain negligible data these have to be cleaned. The narrative wherein the anonymous reporter explains an incident doe not use aviation english always. For instance flight, aircraft, and airplane is used to describe the same object. Therefore the model has to be trained in accordance with varying parameters or the dataset has to be cleaned substantially.\nData Preprocessing The data preprocessing involved the following tasks conversion of all characters to lowercase, stop word removal : specific stops words for aviation ( like aircraft), lemmatization/ stemming/ Tokenization, expand contractions.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) We used python libraries pandas, numpy and matplotlib for exploratory data analysis of the ASRS dataset.\nModel Development To be updated as we progress\nDescribe the algorithms, methodology, and architectures used to generate models. Discuss how models were generated, seeded, and improved. Show the libraries and frameworks used for model development, as well as the rationale behind those choices.\nModel Evaluation To be updated as we progress Discuss the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance, and justify those choices based on the problem that the project is addressing.

The original ASRS dataset has more than 300 thousand rows of information from the year 1988. Since we are specifically interested in runway incursion we applied a filter while downloading the dataset and received a subset of 46,000 rows and 126 columns. The rudimentary goal is to analyse this dataset to identify fracture points in safety regulations.\nData Overview and Examples The ASRS data is anonymised reports collected from individuals working in the aviation sector. The dataset contains the credentials of the reporting person (excluding personally identifiable content), time and date of the incident, name of the airport, state, altitude, visibility, narrative etc. We intend to use a subset of the 127 features already present with us. The reason is that there are multiple features with a negligible amount of data making analysis unfavourable. Therefore we intend to drop those features completely before further processing. ASRS is the largest data repository available for aviation safety incidents therefore any other dataset which is publicly available may either be a subset of ASRS or might not be reliable since ASRS is a government-backed dataset.\nData Accessibility The dataset is accessible through a web portal. There are multiple filters that a user could use to extract the data based on time, type of incident, reporting agency etc. Since we are interested in runway incursions we used word filters like runway, ramp and taxiway. The major constraint for downloading the dataset is at a time only 10,000 rows can be downloaded. Therefore we had to download 5 reports and collate them together.\nData Formats The dataset can be downloaded in Excel, CSV, pdf, word and HTML formats from the ASRS portal. For ease of use with Python, we preferred the usage of csv format.\nData Challenges The most challenging part of the dataset is the narrative. The narrative is a description of the incident from a reporter/observer’s point of view. All the reports available in the dataset are not written in aviation English. For instance, airplane, aircraft and flight may essentially point towards the same object but are written in diverse ways. Similarly, the runway is often time written as rwy. All the reports are not written in a professional manner, for instance in a report pilot makes an attempt to humor by mentioning “spilling coffee in the cockpit”. This information is futile as far as the algorithm is concerned.\nData Visualizations and Highlights Including a visualization is a simple way to show something interesting about the data. Perhaps the visualizations could simply highlight the size, distribution, and other simple statistical characteristics of the data.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697653476,"objectID":"be566fdb6f0fa08cfea50d77a89a6b5a","permalink":"https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-aviation-safety/data/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-aviation-safety/data/","section":"","summary":"Data Assessment Document that gives an overview of the data used for the project.","tags":null,"title":"Data Assessment","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction ‘Air disasters are rare in the US, close calls are a different story’ The New York Times (Front Page) - 23rd August 2023. The article highlights a concerning trend of safety incidents and near misses in the United States’ aviation industry. While there haven’t been major plane crashes for over a decade, close calls involving commercial airlines are occurring frequently, often due to human error and a shortage of air traffic controllers. The number of near misses has doubled in the last decade, raising questions about the safety of the U.S. air travel system. Direct action is needed to improve the situation. NASA maintains a database - ‘Aviation Safety Reporting System’ - that records incident reports of all runway/taxiway incursions since 1988. A treasure trove of untapped potential.\nMotivation The United States alone has an annual passenger traffic of 666 million passengers (in 2021). In recent years aviation safety reporting system has received a record number of incident reports which points to a major question whether the safety standards have been degrading or the number of reports has been increasing. Whatever may be the case there are millions of passengers who travel in these aircraft and therefore it becomes necessary to find out the root causes of these faults.\nProblem for the Semester To analyze aviation incursion reports and determine the primary safety concerns and system fracture points leading to such situations with compelling data. To improve aviation safety through the analysis of NASA’s ASRS data. To use Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models to process data and extract useful statistics from (45000, 126) records that can be used to make suggestions to the concerned authorities and effectively alleviate the ongoing crisis. Setup preliminary foundation for development of an encompassing artificial intelligence model that can dynamically read new reports and provide valuable insights. State of the Art Post-air crash-related incidents usually investigation teams have a flight manifest and black box data to uncover the root cause of the incident. Unlike crashes, near misses do not have black box access therefore problem solving completely relies on anonymous reports. Therefore analysis of these reports becomes the only way to solve this problem.\nDesign and Approach If we treat the data as supervised data and divide it into train and test. The primary problem can be treated as a label. Post this divide we intend to run correlation analysis and feature extraction algorithms like principle component analysis, and linear discriminant analysis. Word2vec or term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) to make narratives into features. Train data over a neural network and test it over a sample set to gauge the accuracy.\nUse Case Scenario The end user for this system could be the Federal Aviation Administration, this system could help them in policy framing. After certain modifications, airlines could use it internally for incident report generation and problem-solving.\nDesired Outcomes and Benefits Given the timeframe of one semester, we find it realistic to focus on a particular type of incident and study it in detail, therefore we intend to focus on runway incursions and identify the fracture points in the system.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1697654898,"objectID":"b7c3446bb0d5d7e8a477294017361379","permalink":"https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-aviation-safety/problem-statement/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-aviation-safety/problem-statement/","section":"","summary":"Problem and Requirements document that will drive the work to be done in the project","tags":null,"title":"Problem and Requirements","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This page contains key sections of the Final Report for the project focused on results to date.

To improve aviation safety through the analysis of NASA’s ASRS data. To use Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models to process data and extract useful statistics from (45000, 126) records that can be used to make suggestions to the concerned authorities and effectively alleviate the ongoing crisis. Setup preliminary foundation for development of an encompassing artificial intelligence model that can dynamically read new reports and provide valuable insights. METHODS EDA of ASRS Dataset using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib Pre-processing TF-IDF Vectorization Lemmatization using spaCy, NLTK Wordcloud ?\nPROPOSED MODEL If we treat data as supervised data and divide the data into train and test. Primary Problem can be treated as our label. Run correlation analysis and feature extraction algos like PCA, LDA to find relevant features from all attributes and word2vec/ Glove or tf-idf to make narrative and synopsis into features. Then train a NN model on this data. Test it over a testing set and see if the model is figuring out the label correctly. For human factors specifically, take out rows which have primary problems as HumanFactors. That is a dataset. Use topics created by previous work to further categorize data using narrative columns. Steps to be taken: a. Data preprocessing: Convert to lower case b. Stop word removal : specific stops words for aviation ( like aircraft) c. lemmatization/ stemming/ Tokenization d. Expand contractions - Try using abbreviations pdf e. EDA : distribution of words/ phrases. Find common terms and patterns. Word clouds and plots f. Keyword extraction: find most significant words (tf-idf can be used) g. Topic modeling : LDA ( use previous work as base to get good topics) h. Runway incursion identification : use topics to find narratives which are runway incursions. i. Context analysis: analyze context for narrative. Factors, people involved, series of events lead to that incident Collect data. Identify examples . what want to extract. 10-20 cases\nQuestions: Are we supposed to make a new project or build upon existing work done by the last team? From the report, we can study that they have taken a lot of the same steps we are working on. Can we get access to get their project? Do we need to make a poster or ppt? What is the Mid-term presentation format? Is poster necessary? Data Doubts: ‘Weather Element/Visibility’ Numeric Value Meaning ‘Ceiling’ value meaning and usefulness? 0- completely fogged. ‘Flight Phase’ with multiple phases, eg: Parked; Landing; Landing, etc ‘Operating Under FAR Part’ meaning? How should we handle the same columns for different aircrafts and persons? Need some direction for where to proceed. The dataset description says that this dataset cannot be used for actual implementation since it is not approved by the FAA.\nMinutes of Meeting:\nUpload data and other useful materials to github for the profs to review Focus of incursions Get better results than absurd or ridiculous Visibility in miles More the ceiling, the better (height of the clouds) - 0 ceiling: full fog Different stages the plane went through in Flight Phase FAR: Part 91 - general, part 121 - airlines, etc Power point presentation at ASRS meeting has 4 factors to identify the incursions https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov/docs/general.pdf https://www.atsapsafety.org/ https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/website/editions/2023-fall/ Midterm presentation Friday, October 20, 5-7pm SAL 101 (not Wednesday) GitHub Austin incident: https://github.com/ckids-datafirst/2023-fall-aviation-safety/blob/main/content/data/news_articles.md GitHub aviation safety: https://github.com/ckids-datafirst/2023-fall-aviation-safety Check for fatigue …","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698452540,"objectID":"4104db7f54dba08fb3e5befc1ab18a2d","permalink":"https://ckids-datafirst.github.io/2023-fall-aviation-safety/meetings/midterm_presentation_collaboration/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2023-fall-aviation-safety/meetings/midterm_presentation_collaboration/","section":"meetings","summary":"Requirements: Introduction/Motivation (why should people be interested in this project?)

Hint: To classify the data, we can check for keywords like fatigue, extra hours etc. which are related to “overtime” in the Narrative column of the ASRS dataset. Data Doubts: ‘Weather Element/Visibility’ Numeric Value Meaning Ans: The numeric value denotes visibility in miles. ‘Ceiling’ value meaning and usefulness? 0- completely fogged. Ans: More the ceiling (height of the clouds), the better is the visibility. ‘Flight Phase’ with multiple phases, eg: Parked; Landing; Landing, etc Ans: They represent the different stages that the plane went through in during the incident. Some cells have redundant stages. ‘Operating Under FAR Part’ meaning? Ans: The Federal Aviation Regulations (FARs) are rules prescribed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) governing all aviation activities in the United States. Check out the power point presentation that was presented at an ASRS meeting and has 4 factors to identify the incursions. It was shared to us by Prof. Najmedin earlier in the emails. The team can get an award if everyone does a good job and wins the International Society of Air Safety Investigators (ISASI) conference. This year it will be held at Lisbon, Portugal.
